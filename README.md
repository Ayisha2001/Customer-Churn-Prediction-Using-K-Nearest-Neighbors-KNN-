# Customer-Churn-Prediction-Using-K-Nearest-Neighbors-KNN-
This project builds and evaluates a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier to predict customer churn. Churn prediction helps businesses identify customers at risk of leaving, enabling proactive retention strategies.
Project Features
Preprocessing: Data cleaning, label encoding for categorical features, and feature scaling.

KNN Modeling: Includes grid search to optimize the number of neighbors.

Evaluation: Reports classification metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

Easily Adaptable: Can be customized for any structured churn dataset.
